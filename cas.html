      <p><strong>COLLEGE OF ARTS AND SCIENCES</strong><br><br></center>
      The College of Arts and Sciences advocates an education directed towards the development of the whole person - one that nurtures the intellectual maturity and moral integrity necessary to face the realities and challenges of a rapidly changing world.<br><br>
      As the academic center and intellectual heart of the University, the College of Arts and Sciences assumes the responsibility of providing a liberal education for all University of the Cordilleras students.<br><br>
      The basic mission of the College is to increase knowledge of students in the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences and in their understanding of the world and themselves and to sharpen their skills and instill self-discipline so that they may lead a richer, more rewarding life and become productive members of the Philippine society and the world at large.<br><br>
      <strong>History</strong><br><br>
      The College of Arts and Sciences prides itself as being one of the first academic departments of the then Baguio Colleges Foundation, now the University of the Cordilleras. When BCF opened its doors on June 19, 1946, some of its initial course offerings were in the Liberal Arts. After a few years, the department produced eighteen (18) graduates with the title Associate in Arts (A.A.). By 1953, it graduated nine (9) with the degree Bachelor of Arts (A.B.)<br><br>

The number of Bachelor of Arts graduates increased rapidly that in 1978, the number of major fields offered also increased. The name of the department was changed from Liberal Arts to Arts and Sciences.<br><br>

Throughout the succeeding years, the college not only maintained its high standing in the institution, but also its steady progress. By 1985, after the recognition of all its existing courses and in keeping with the institutional objectives and the needs of society, the college offered two additional new courses: Bachelor of Science in Information and Computer Science and Bachelor of Science in Criminology, which have now become separate colleges.<br><br>

In 1999, the College was granted Level II Accreditation and Level II Re-accreditation in 2006 by the Philippine Accrediting Association of Schools, Colleges and Universities (PAASCU), which signifies that the College has reached and maintained the standards set for accreditation.
